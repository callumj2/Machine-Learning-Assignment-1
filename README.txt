Hi! Welcome to my COMP30027, Assignment 1 Submission
In order to run the code contained here, you will need to install the following
programs/python packages:

1. Python 3
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas and all it's dependencies (see https://pandas.pydata.org/)
4. SciPy
5. MatPlotLib

Report.pdf contains the report for the assignment.
Code.ipynb contains all the relevant code for the work done. It can be opened
through Jupyter Notebook and is structured as followed:

TITLE / Author
-> General Setup
    - preprocess()
    - predict_set()

-> Part 1: Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
    - train()
    - predict()
    - get_name()

-> Part 2: KDE Naive Bayes Classifier (Question 3)
    - train()
    - predict()
    
-> Part 3: Evaluating the models
    - Baseline classifiers
    - Confusion Matrices
    - Multiclass Evaluation Methods (Question 1)
    - Evaluate()
    - Graphing results()

-> Part 4: Tests / running the models

The code should run as long as all other contents of the zip file are extracted 
into the same directory.

Markdown cells have been included to help you navigate through the code,
however some code blocks are quite large so make sure you read the relevant
markdown cell before diving in to avoid any confusion.
